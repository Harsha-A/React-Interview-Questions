# 🧩 Week 1 — Advanced React Architecture & Design Patterns

> 🎯 Goal: Learn to design, scale, and organize large React applications with clean architecture, reusable patterns, and modular state management.

---

## 🧱 1. Scalable Folder Structure for Large React Apps

When your app grows beyond a few components, a clear folder structure is key for scalability and maintainability.

### ✅ Recommended Structure
```bash
src/
 ┣ components/          # Reusable UI components (Button, Modal, Input)
 ┣ features/            # Business-level features (Auth, Dashboard, Cart)
 ┣ hooks/               # Custom reusable hooks
 ┣ services/            # API calls / network layer
 ┣ store/               # Global state (Redux / Zustand / Context)
 ┣ utils/               # Helper functions, formatters
 ┣ types/               # Global TypeScript types/interfaces
 ┗ App.tsx
````

### 💡 Why Feature-Based Structure?

* Improves modularity (each feature is self-contained)
* Easier code ownership for multiple teams
* Reduces merge conflicts
* Enables micro-frontend migration in the future

## 🧩 2. Advanced Component Patterns

React patterns let you design reusable, composable, and testable UIs.

---

### 🧠 A. Compound Components Pattern

```jsx
const Tabs = ({ children }) => {
  const [active, setActive] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) =>
        React.cloneElement(child, { active, setActive, index })
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

const TabList = ({ children, active, setActive }) => (
  <div className="flex gap-2">
    {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => (
      <button
        className={index === active ? "font-bold" : ""}
        onClick={() => setActive(index)}
      >
        {child}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
);

const TabPanel = ({ children, index, active }) => (
  <div>{index === active && children}</div>
);

// Usage
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <div>Home</div>
    <div>Profile</div>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanel>Home Content</TabPanel>
  <TabPanel>Profile Content</TabPanel>
</Tabs>
```

**💬 Interview Insight:**

> Compound components promote flexibility and encapsulate shared state logic while allowing composition from outside.

---

### 🧠 B. Render Props Pattern

```jsx
const MouseTracker = ({ children }) => {
  const [pos, setPos] = React.useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  return (
    <div onMouseMove={e => setPos({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY })}>
      {children(pos)}
    </div>
  );
};

// Usage
<MouseTracker>
  {({ x, y }) => <h4>Mouse Position: {x}, {y}</h4>}
</MouseTracker>
```

**💬 Interview Insight:**

> Render props allow logic reuse without inheritance or hooks. Useful when multiple components need shared, dynamic data.

---

### 🧠 C. Higher-Order Components (HOC)

```jsx
const withLogger = (Component) => {
  return function Wrapped(props) {
    React.useEffect(() => console.log("Mounted:", Component.name), []);
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
};

// Usage
const Dashboard = () => <div>Dashboard</div>;
export default withLogger(Dashboard);
```

**💬 Interview Insight:**

> HOCs wrap existing components to enhance functionality without modifying internal code — think decorators.

---

### 🧠 D. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

```jsx
// Controlled
<input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />

// Uncontrolled
<input ref={inputRef} defaultValue="John" />
```

**💬 Interview Insight:**

> Controlled components offer predictable data flow — essential for form validation and controlled side effects.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse

Hooks are your best tool to abstract and reuse logic.

### 💻 Example: `useDebounce`

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export function useDebounce(value, delay = 300) {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(handler);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debounced;
}
```

**Usage**

```jsx
const search = useDebounce(input, 500);
```

**💬 Interview Insight:**

> Custom hooks simplify shared logic without increasing complexity.

## 🧠 4. State Management Architecture

Choosing the right state management library is an architectural decision.

| Approach                 | When to Use             | Pros                          | Cons                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Context + useReducer** | Medium apps             | Simple, built-in              | Re-renders all children |
| **Redux Toolkit**        | Large apps              | Centralized store, middleware | Some boilerplate        |
| **Zustand**              | Modern lightweight apps | Simple, scalable              | Smaller ecosystem       |
| **Jotai / Recoil**       | Fine-grained reactivity | Minimal re-renders            | Less mature             |

### 💻 Example (Zustand)

```jsx
import create from "zustand";

export const useStore = create(set => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
}));

const Counter = () => {
  const { count, increment } = useStore();
  return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>;
};
```

## 🧰 5. Real-world Architecture Example

Example: **E-commerce Dashboard**

```
src/
 ┣ features/
 │   ┣ Auth/
 │   │   ┣ Login.tsx
 │   │   ┗ useAuth.ts
 │   ┣ Cart/
 │   │   ┣ CartPage.tsx
 │   │   ┗ useCart.ts
 │   ┗ Products/
 │       ┣ ProductList.tsx
 │       ┗ useProducts.ts
 ┣ services/
 │   ┗ api.ts
 ┣ store/
 │   ┗ useGlobalStore.ts
 ┗ App.tsx
```

**Key Design Decisions**

* Reusable API client (`services/api.ts`)
* Each feature owns its hooks and components
* Zustand/Context for global state (user info, theme)
* Lazy-load each feature route

## 🧩 6. Common Senior-Level Interview Questions (Week 1)

| Question                                                    | What They’re Testing      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| “Explain how you organize your React project.”              | Architecture thinking     |
| “How do you decide between Redux, Context, or Zustand?”     | Design decision reasoning |
| “Can you show a use case for compound components?”          | Pattern understanding     |
| “How do you avoid prop drilling at scale?”                  | State management depth    |
| “How do you ensure maintainability in a 50+ component app?” | Modularity and structure  |

## 🧰 7. Homework / Repo Tasks

**Folder:** `/week1-advanced-architecture/`

1. Implement the **Tabs (Compound Component)** example
2. Create a **custom hook** (`useLocalStorage` or `useDebounce`)
3. Build a small **feature module** (e.g., `UserProfile`) with folder isolation
4. Write a **README.md** explaining:

   * Architecture choice
   * Pattern used
   * Why that pattern is beneficial

---

✅ **End of Week 1:**
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

* Justify *architectural decisions* in an interview
* Demonstrate *pattern-based design*
* Write *reusable, composable code* like a senior engineer
