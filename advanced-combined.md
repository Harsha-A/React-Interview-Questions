## 🧰 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
````

2. Navigate to each week's folder and follow the **README** for tasks and examples.
3. Implement code examples and complete homework for hands-on practice.
4. Use these tasks to prepare for **senior React interviews (SDE-3 level)**.
